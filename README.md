## How to compile and run the project
The easiest way to run our project is to download the "work" folder from Vocareum, unzip it, and compile and run through an IDE like IntelliJ. Alternatively, you can compile each file in terminal, however, we strongly suggest you use an IDE since there are many files and they are in packages. 
When you run the project, for the best experience we suggest making the terminal/run window as big as possible. Some of the menus have many options, so extending the size of the window will help you see what is happening.
